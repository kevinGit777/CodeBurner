Problem A
Canonical Coin Systems
A useful fact (due to Dexter Kozen and Shmuel Zaks) is that if S is non-canonical, 
then the smallest counterexample is less than the sum of the two largest denominations.

for number from 0 to less than sum of two lergest num 
find greedy algorithm and possible optimal and than compare them
